# VNFT (Vara Non-Fungible Token)

The VNFT program represents a non-fungible token (NFT) contract that integrates a comprehensive role management system. It facilitates the creation of NFTs with customizable metadata attributes, including name, description, media, and reference links. The contract supports core NFT operations such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens, while managing token ownership and approvals. Additionally, the contract enforces role-based access control, ensuring that permissions for minting and burning are properly delegated to authorized actors, thereby maintaining the security and integrity of the system.
